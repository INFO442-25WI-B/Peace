## Justification
### Problem Statement
After much discussion, we realized that one shared frustration was dealing with entitled individuals who project their anger onto others. While this behavior is frustrating, we also understand that anger often stems from personal struggles and unaddressed emotions.
During our research, we found that while there are apps focused on controlling or managing anger—like QuitAnger, which tracks anger levels and offers muscle relaxation, grounding techniques, and educational resources, or AIMS, which provides tools and planning specifically for veterans—there wasn't really a space that just lets people feel their anger in the moment, without judgment. We also came across Kick the Boss, which provides a funny outlet for workplace rage, and Tappy, a simple fidget tool, but those are either super specific or limited in how they help process deeper emotions.
This made us realize there was room for something different: an app that not only helps you manage frustration but gives you permission to express it in healthy, playful ways while promoting emotional intelligence and self-growth.
That realization inspired us to create ANGER—a digital platform designed to provide a constructive outlet for frustration through interactive tools, guided exercises, and calming techniques. ANGER empowers individuals to process emotions in a healthier way, ultimately fostering a more understanding and compassionate community.
By redirecting negativity into self-improvement (and giving you fun ways to safely rage out), we aim to turn anger into an opportunity for growth, change, and maybe even a little laughter.
